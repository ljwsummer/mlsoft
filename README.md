# mlsoft
## Introduction
mlsoft is a machine learning toolkit, as well as an easy-to-use **framework**. You can use various learning, evaluation, and analysis algorithms in this package ([*how to use*](#todo-keep-updating)). Moreover, you can also add your own learning and analysis algorithms written by any programming language to this package([*how to do*](#how-to-add-your-own-algorithms)). Contact me if you have any new idea.

##ToDo (keep updating)
* Learning Algorithms
   * ~~linear regression~~ [*example*](https://github.com/ljwsummer/mlsoft/blob/master/examples/linear_reg_example.py)
   * logistic regression
   * neural networks
   * support vector machine
   * gradient boosting machine
   * random forests
* Analysis and Evaluation
   * bias and variance analysis
   * hypothesis testing
   * F-Score for classification
   * dcg, ndcg, err for ranking

##How to add your own algorithms
please wait me for a moment...

##Dependency
* NumPy 1.7.0-1. [*HomePage*](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)
* python-nose 1.2.1-1. We use nose as our unit test tool.
* Gnuplot 4.6.1. [*HomePage*](http://www.gnuplot.info/)
